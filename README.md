[Live Deploy 🌎](https://socializerme.vercel.app/) \*Also with **demo** account! - [API Documentation 🖨️](https://github.com/janaiscoding/socializer/tree/main/backend#readme)

- Enhanced the user and developer experience by integrating the **React Context API** and **Custom Hooks**.
- Implemented **debouncing** on certain functions, in order to reduce the API calls and improve overall UX.
- Implemented a stable solution for dealing with image manipulation by relying on Cloudinary SaaS CDN, **improving performance by 90%** on fetching posts.
- Secured sensitive information by adhering to using .env variables in all branches of the project.
- All project routes are protected by verifying **JWT Token**. You can only access the app by validating the token with the API.
- For UI I followed a **mobile-first approach** recommended by TailwindCSS best practices and opted for a **clean, modern design**, temporarily for light-mode only.
- Focused on creating an **accessible-friendly** experience, with a **95+ overall score** on Lighthouse scans.
