# Socializer. Full-stack Social Media Platform ü´∂

Record and share your amazing life moments, beautiful pictures or random thoughts. Make friends and stay connected.

[Live Deploy üåé](https://socializerme.vercel.app/) - Also with **demo** account!

- Enhanced the user and developer experience by integrating the **React Context API**, **Custom Hooks**.
- Implemented debouncing on certain functions, in order to reduce the API calls and improve overall UX.
- Implemented a stable solution for dealing with image manipulation by relying on Cloudinary SaaS CDN, **improving performance on fetching by 90%**.
- Secured sensitive information by adhering to using .env variables in all branches of the project.
- All project routes are protected by verifying JWT Token. You can only access the app by validating the token with the API.
- For UI I followed a mobile-first approach recommended by TailwindCSS best practices and opted for a clean design, temporarily for light-mode only.
- Focused on creating an accessible-friendly experience, with a **95+ Accessibility score** on Lighthouse scans.
